## CasinoGames
A folder consisting of some Python files that combine to form a terminal-based "casino". Note: as of 8.29.2022, the Blackjack game works but the Texas Hold'Em game does not. Also, there is no use of actual money in any of these programs. It is all based completely on made-up money that is really just pre-set numbers, and is solely for entertainment.
