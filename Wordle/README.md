# Wordle

The current (as of 4/14/2022) "wordleBot" file is a wordle "bot". Bot is in quotes because this script doesn't tell the user what words to enter; it simply suggest words that match the input criteria.

The "Wordle Small List.txt" is the file that contains the list of potential wordle words (answers).

The "Wordle Large List.txt" is the file that contains the list of all words that Wordle will accept as valid guesses.
